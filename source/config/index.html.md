Every app is unique and it's important to be able to configure your environment to your app's specific needs. With Nanobox, environment configuration is centralized in a single file - your `boxfile.yml`.

The next few docs walk through the specifics of the boxfile as well as other things to consider when building your app's platform:

[Runtime & Services](/app-config/runtime-services/)  
[Environment Variables](/app-config/environment-variables/)  
[Adding Packages](/app-config/adding-packages/)  
[Application Logs](/app-config/app-logs/)  
[Network Storage](/app-config/network-storage/)  
[Writable Directories](/app-config/writable-dirs/)  
[Cron Jobs](/app-config/cron-jobs/)
